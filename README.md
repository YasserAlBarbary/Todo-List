# Todo-List
### a Todo list website built with Node.js and MongoDB
In this project I have used EJS and Node.js to build a todo list<br>
All the data is stored in a MongoDB so you can retrive your data anytime.
You have the option to add and remove items to your list<br?
you can also makke custom lists by going to
``` 
localhost:3000/{your custom list name}
```
### in newer versions you will be able to:
1 Access all custom lists using  the UI.<br>
2 Have access to a deployable version online rather than the localy hosted one
